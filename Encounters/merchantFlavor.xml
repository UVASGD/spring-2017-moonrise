		<description>A merchant selling his wares waves you over and presents a set of beaten up plate armor: "Lots of folks are splurging on tough leather. Maybe they think that it will protect them from a bite or two. A mature werewolf can bite clean throught this stuff! What you need is plate... or at least a lot of layers. When I tell them that they think I'm just shooting for a little more coin. Fools. "</description>
